The repository is organized as follows:

* **`training data`**
  Contains all datasets collected from our previous experiments. These images and annotations were used to train the U-Net model.

* **`newest data`**
  Holds the most recent experimental images, which were reserved exclusively for evaluating U-Net’s segmentation performance.

* **`SKM (objectivity testing)`**
  Includes the raw and processed data corresponding to Figure 3 in the manuscript, demonstrating the model’s ability to deliver consistent, objective results.

* **`SKM (robustness testing)`**
  Contains the datasets used for Figure 4, designed to challenge the model under various perturbations and verify its robustness.
